            <p>Once upon a time there was a Chinese farmer whose horse ran away. That evening, all of his neighbors came
                around to commiserate. They said,</p>
            <div id="floatquote"><q class="villagers">We are so sorry to hear your horse has run away. This is most
                    unfortunate.</q></div>
            <p>The farmer said,
                <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the horse came back bringing seven wild horses with it, and in the evening everybody came back and said,
                <q class ="villagers">Oh, isn’t that lucky. What a great turn of events. You now have eight horses!</q> The farmer again said,
                <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q></p>
            <p>The following day his son tried to break one of the horses, and while riding it, he was thrown and broke his leg. The neighbors then said,
                <q class="villagers">Oh dear, that’s too bad,</q> and the farmer responded, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe</em>.</q> The next day the conscription officers came around to conscript people into the army, and they rejected his son because he had a broken leg. Again all the neighbors came around and said, <q class="villagers">Isn’t that great!</q> Again, he said, <q class="farmer"><em>Maybe.</em></q></p>
            <blockquote>
                <q>The whole process of nature is an integrated process of immense complexity, and it’s really impossible to tell whether anything that happens in it is <span class="good">good</span> or <span class="bad">bad</span> — because you never know what will be the consequence of the misfortune; or, you never know what will be the consequences of <span class="good">good</span> fortune.</q> <br>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p><span class="good">Good</span> and <span class="bad">Bad</span> are just one perspective. Bananas are good for monkeys, but monkeys are not good for bananas. Let's not make a big deal out of it...</p>
